This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).



## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. You can get these keys from their respective service dashboards.

```bash
# Supabase credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# Vapi Public Key
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=your-vapi-public-key

# OpenAI API Key (for server-side API routes)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
